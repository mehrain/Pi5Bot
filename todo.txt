Ensure that database logic code only comes from BDDB instead of querying the pokeapi. 
Maybe move casting/validation to a separate class/file/method.
As I mentioned earlier, regarding data quality, validate before inserting instead of after.
Track down DB integrity bug instead of working around it, likely related to archmages possibly falling from leaderboard after resetting. (Tip from OCAmlMan)
